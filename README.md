# Dotfiles

Theses are Dotfiles for easy boostraping and backup of any of my macs. 

#### Features 
- iterm2
- homebrew
- nvim
- ohmyzsh
- tmux

Nvim module is heavily influenced by [Jess Archer](https://github.com/jessarcher). Checkout their course at [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/neovim-as-a-php-ide).

Also got inspiration by looking at some examples at [Dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/inspiration/)

### Installation

````
chmod +x install

./install
````

It's a good idea to take a look at the `install` bash script to get an feel for what is happening. 

Lines are commented so it should be easy to follow.


### Iterm2

Currently I use the backup feature available for iterm2. There should be a better and more programmatic way of getting things in sync. I am searching.
